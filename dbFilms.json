I was waiting for this movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie.

And what I got from the movie was equal with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't really get to know them... and the other characters were only there for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing!

All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've played warcraft and wow for many years since when I was 13 or 14 years old. Ever since then, I haven't stopped playing. Therefore you can count me as a fan. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it at a pre-screening, and I kept wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for the fans. I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence.\n\nThose who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the lore lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? \n\nOK, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Duncan's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the lore and books which may or may not be compatible with that of Duncan's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Chris Metzen; that's the thing with story: each player / reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, Stormwind, Goldshire, Ironforge, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.\n\nAs for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the story a lot. The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I had never seen orcs in such detail before, hulky, robust, terrifyingly but also relative.\n\nQuite frankly, I can't wait for the next movie... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again when I can. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually play WoW. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsibility, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. That will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.","user_score_count":891,"user_name":"Nate Nimbus"},"certificate":{"certificate":"PG-13","attr":"(certificate #49858)"},"has":["more_cast","trivia","goofs","quotes","more_plot","parentalguide","synopsis","user_comments","external_reviews","photos"],"writers_summary":[{"name":{"nconst":"nm0495378","name":"Charles Leavitt"},"attr":"(screenplay) and"},{"name":{"nconst":"nm1512910","name":"Duncan Jones","image":{"width":1314,"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3Mzk4MDQzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5MTM4NA@@._V1_.jpg","height":2048}},"attr":"(screenplay)"}],"rating":7.2,"num_votes":137446,"tconst":"tt0803096","genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"best_plot":{"outline":"As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.","total_summaries":2},"quote":{"lines":[{"stage":"from trailer"},{"quote":"I've led thousands of warriors into battle, but I fear being a father.

It is IMO near perfect on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, fun and superbly done.\n\nThe first film delivers a lot of action, a tantalizing and beautiful love interest, many humorous moments, powerful messages about internal fortitude and courage, a classic villain, fine acting and many of the basic essentials of any good action movie. This sequel adds an intriguing plot and does everything the first film did but does it BETTER. Including, incredible stunts, unbelievable feats and, not to be rude, but a climax that plays out like a multiple orgasm. The finish features one wave after another of edge of your seat moments.

most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date","user_score":282,"text":"(Rating: 12A, 121 mins) Written by Zen Terrelonge \n\nStarring В– Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel\n\nIf you've seen the trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy, you'd be within your rights to think Marvel Studio execs have been hitting the bottle hard or taking LSD.\n\nThe film revolves around a group of dysfunctional but goodhearted criminals В– think Robin Hood's Merry Men of the future В– comprising human thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Pratt), green assassin Gamora (Saldana), talking raccoon Rocket (Cooper), knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), and walking tree Groot (Diesel).\n\nLike the Avengers, the Guardians get off to a false start but soon unite over a common cause, namely, the galaxy being obliterated by genocidal maniac, Ronan В– not Keating В– the Accuser.\n\nAh yes, the old, let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy.\n\nBut unlike Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly, it's the most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date.\n\nIt's a hell of an achievement given the extensive movie library the company is building up and when you consider the characters aren't household names like 'big three' Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but Marvel seems well aware of that fact with the final production risky to say the least.\n\nThe film opens in 1988, which is when Quill is abducted from Earth, and 26 years later we see he's become a crooked intergalactic outlaw with a taste for all things shiny, valuable and not his.\n\nGiven the distinct decade in which he was taken, his cassette player and mixtape of 70s and 80s tracks are laced throughout the film, which creates a quirky yet grounded quality in the midst of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way.\n\nIn addition to the soundtrack, jokes and comedy have never been more of a feature in a Marvel film В– perhaps Iron Man 3 was the closest В– as gags are thrown into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the tension, and I would imagine, to really differentiate itself from Avengers Assemble, Star Wars and Star Trek, which by comparison are left looking very sombre.\n\nThat said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk В– smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.\n\nThe editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally, the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward or forced.\n\nThor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such excellent casting.\n\nMeanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at, meaning sequel fodder.\n\nThere's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without hesitation.\n\nGuardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to the top.\n\n10/10","user_location":"United

Everyone is losing their minds over the film on social media billing it as the best film they've ever seen ever. I think its got something to do with 'breaking the fourth wall' (something Malcolm in the Middle did expertly), making jokes only funny in a 13 year-old boy's changing rooms, unnecessary graphic violence and nudity which is absolutely unnecessary... that is until you realise that this film has been written by/for people who still think farts are funny. The humour in this film isn't even as sophisticated as White Chicks or Scary Movie. It's not a parody either. As an example, the guy behind the bar delivers his lines like he's reading them for the first time. No comic timing, no life, no urgency. That may be his character but whatever comedy is supposed to be in his dialogue goes missing immediately. They also take jokes too far. Sometimes, just leading a viewer into the realm of a joke is fine, leave them there, let them get it themselves - not Deadpool. It's like they knew people with the sense of humour of a 9 year old would be relishing every pointlessly gory banal second and they not only explain the joke, but they keep talking a good minute after the joke has been, gone and not been laughed at; still telling the same joke. \n\nIn short - no, this is not the best film you've ever seen ever. For that (in a comic book adaptation), go watch The Dark Knight or The Avengers. This film's storyline, jokes and content have all been either written by or for adolescent boys who still think 'boobies' are things to snigger behind your hand at at the back of a biology lesson. Everyone involved in this film needs to grow up and so do the people leaving 10 star reviews. I'm sure if they watched Postman Pat the movie and he swore, they'd give that 10 stars too.","user_location":"Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear","user_score_count":134},"certificate":{"certificate":"R","attr":"(certificate #49920)"},"has":["more_cast","trivia","goofs","quotes","more_writers","more_plot","parentalguide","synopsis","user_comments","external_reviews","photos"],"writers_summary":[{"name":{"nconst":"nm1014201","name":"Rhett Reese"},"attr":"(written by) and"},{"name":{"nconst":"nm1116660","name":"Paul Wernick"},"attr":"(written by) ..."}],"rating":8.1,"num_votes":511457,"tconst":"tt1431045","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"best_plot":{"outline":"A fast-talking mercenary with a morbid sense of humor is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a quest for revenge.","total_summaries":3},"quote":{"lines":[{"stage":"first lines"},{"quote":"Kinda lonesome back here.

We were all, even marvel fan boys, waiting for this movie. The two most well known superheroes fighting... what could go wrong!? A lot. \n\nThe positives:\n\n1. Batman & Alfred; Batfleck was amazing! Ben Affleck represented a batman that is damaged, changed his moral code(which if they play their cards right could be a center piece of solo batman films) and made him more bad-ass because of it. \n\n2. The action: Amazing Action! It's thrilling, exciting and beautifully shot. That is what Zack does though and I expected nothing less. \n\n3. Wonder woman: Supringsly well done. Her as Diana prince was maybe a bit stiff sometimes but she can make the character her own along the way. I trust her that much. Her as wonder woman was amazing!! I got chills when she joined the fight!\n\n4. Cinematography is general. It is a beautiful film to look at. Nicely shot and as I said the action is amazing. The CGI in certain places are a bit \"meh\" and one shot did take me out of the movie, but that's it. \n\nNow the bad stuff why this movie went downhill:\n\n1. the editing/pacing: Guys, this movie was a mess. The movie begins great with an introduction of batman and some stuff you saw in the trailer. Then we go to a scene... which tells us a story then it goes to another scene. You're invested in that particular and then it jump cuts to another scene. You are seeing 4 different story lines play out in 5 minute scenes after each other. As a general movie goer-ER you will lose track. As a DC-fan, as myself, I could understand everything but i needed to bring all my previous knowledge to actually understand. Really bad pacing\n\n2. Superman: Not everyone will agree on this, but I think they handled superman horribly. He needs to be symbol of hope and yet he is never exactly that. There was certain montage, where it should shown that he was, but i never felt that he was. This representation was too dark. This was also more of a batman movie with superman playing a small part in that, yet batman's world is too dark for superman. If you want to combine their worlds, let Batman play a role in superman's world. \n\n3. Lex Luther. I hated his representation of the power hungry and menacing villain. He played mark suckable and was a complete miscast. I don't care if he was the son of the \"real\" lex Luther. It didn't fit. \n\n4. Doomsday: A complete waste of a great story arc. Why did they bring him in while there was so much going on.. \n\n5. The justice league set up: It felt rushed. The way they shoehorned all the other characters in was lazy writing. \n\n6. the whole motivation of superman fighting batman. batman's motivation was clear and great. Superman's was horrible. They were one conversation away from understanding each other, but they had to fight of course.\n\n7. Many many plot holes, but i cant go into those because i don't wanna spoil the whole movie. \n\nverdict: If you love flashy action.. go watch it in Max. If you like great story.. wait till it releases on blue-ray.\n\n6 out of 10 for a mediocre movie that should been an epic man. I was so disappointed. I see so many DC fans raging this movie was epic, but we're dealing with the phantom menace effect.","user_score_count":841,"user_name":"Vinay Sital"},"certificate":{"certificate":"PG-13","attr":"(certificate #50064)"},"has":["more_cast","trivia","goofs","quotes","more_writers","more_plot","parentalguide","synopsis","user_comments","external_reviews","photos"],"writers_summary":[{"name":{"nconst":"nm0006516","name":"Chris Terrio","image":{"width":435,"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MzA1ODg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEwMTgy._V1_.jpg","height":650}},"attr":"(written by) and"},{"name":{"nconst":"nm0333060","name":"David S.
